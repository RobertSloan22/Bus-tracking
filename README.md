# Bus-tracking
Real time bus tracking 

This is to demonstrate the use of the mapbox api along with the data provided by the mbta developer portal 

Bus stops between the campus of M.I.T and Harvard are shown on the map.

Future improvements to this would include a tracking line to draw along the bus route.
